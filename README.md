# boilerplate
The customized boilerplate that I use for HTML5 pages.

## Features

* Elements, their margins, and their paddings are laid out on a 20Ã—20 pixel grid
* Font sizes for headings are based on the Fibonacci sequence
* Included classes for columns and golden ratio columns
* All possible favicon `head` tags

## See it Live

* Check out [the live boilerplate page itself](https://doublecompile.github.io/boilerplate)

## Bundled Libraries

* Included you'll find a custom build of Modernizr that detects support for the `hyphens` and `text-overflow` CSS rules. Modernizr is available under an MIT License, just like this boilerplate.
